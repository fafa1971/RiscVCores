There are many free (as in speech) good quality RISC-V CPU cores available. Here we focus on those written directly in Verilog, or those written in other languages but can be "generated" into plain Verilog (or synthesizable SystemVerilog) code.

Examples of such languages are Chisel (based on Scala, and used for the Rocket chip and for Berkeley BOOM) and SpinalHDL (also based on Scala, and used for the Vex and Nax processors by Charles Papon - aka dolu1990).

For those already available in Verilog, we can simply provide a link; for those to be generated, we provide the generated files. There is a category in between which are cores written in another language but for which another third party website already stores the generated Verilog code, for example Rocket and Vex.
